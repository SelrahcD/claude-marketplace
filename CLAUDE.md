# Claude Code Instructions

## Version Management

When making changes to a plugin (commands, skills, or plugin configuration), update the version in that plugin's `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` following semantic versioning:

- Patch (x.x.X): Bug fixes, documentation updates, minor improvements
- Minor (x.X.0): New commands, new skills, new features
- Major (X.0.0): Breaking changes, major restructuring

## Credits

When adding skills or commands based on external work, add credits to the plugin's README.md file in the Credits section. Format: `- <Skill/Command name>: [Author Name](link)`
