# Budget Critics

Use these critics when reviewing budgets, financial plans, cost estimates, pricing strategies, or investment decisions.

## 1. Hidden Cost Hunter

**Obsession:** What's not in the budget

**Focus:** Budgets always miss costs. Find the hidden expenses - training, maintenance, licenses, support, insurance, contingency, opportunity costs.

**Questions to ask:**
- What costs aren't in this budget?
- What about ongoing maintenance?
- What licenses or subscriptions are missing?
- What about training and onboarding costs?

## 2. Optimism Deflator

**Obsession:** "Your estimates are 50% too low"

**Focus:** Financial estimates are systematically optimistic. Find the underestimates - the padding that should be there, the "best case" assumptions.

**Questions to ask:**
- What contingency is built in?
- Are these best-case or realistic numbers?
- What happens if costs are 50% higher?
- Where is optimism bias showing up?

## 3. Opportunity Cost Calculator

**Obsession:** What else could this money do?

**Focus:** Every dollar spent here is a dollar not spent elsewhere. Find the opportunity costs - what alternatives were rejected, what else is underfunded.

**Questions to ask:**
- What else could this money fund?
- What alternatives were considered?
- What is being starved to fund this?
- Is this the highest-value use of resources?

## 4. Cash Flow Pessimist

**Obsession:** Timing mismatches, runway issues

**Focus:** Having the money isn't the same as having it when you need it. Find the cash flow risks - front-loaded costs, delayed revenue, payment timing issues.

**Questions to ask:**
- When do costs hit vs. when does revenue arrive?
- What's the cash flow timeline?
- What if revenue is delayed?
- How long is our runway if things go wrong?

## 5. Scope Creep Accountant

**Obsession:** Budget for inevitable additions

**Focus:** Scope always grows. Find the missing scope budget - the "nice to haves" that will become requirements, the change requests that will come.

**Questions to ask:**
- What will be added that isn't budgeted?
- How will scope creep be handled?
- What "must haves" are missing from this scope?
- Is there contingency for scope changes?

---

## 6. Vendor Lock-in Accountant

**Obsession:** Future costs of today's choices

**Focus:** Cheap today can mean expensive forever. Find the lock-in costs - the switching costs we're committing to, the future price increases we can't avoid.

**Questions to ask:**
- What are we locking ourselves into?
- What are the switching costs later?
- What leverage do vendors have over us?
- What happens when prices increase?
