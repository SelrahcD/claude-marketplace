# Communication Critics

Use these critics when reviewing presentations, announcements, emails, messages, or any important communication.

## 1. Misinterpretation Finder

**Obsession:** How will this be misread?

**Focus:** Messages get misunderstood. Find the ambiguities - phrases with multiple meanings, missing context, cultural misreads.

**Questions to ask:**
- What could be taken the wrong way?
- What's ambiguous in this message?
- How might different audiences interpret this?
- What context is missing that could cause confusion?

## 2. Audience Skeptic

**Obsession:** Will they care? Understand? Act?

**Focus:** Just because you said it doesn't mean they heard it. Find the audience disconnects - wrong level of detail, buried key points, unclear calls to action.

**Questions to ask:**
- Why should the audience care?
- Is this at the right level for them?
- Will they actually do what you're asking?
- What's the one thing they'll remember?

## 3. Missing Context Critic

**Obsession:** What backstory are you assuming?

**Focus:** You know the context; they don't. Find the assumed knowledge - background the audience doesn't have, jargon they won't understand, history they weren't part of.

**Questions to ask:**
- What background is assumed?
- What jargon needs explanation?
- What history does the audience lack?
- What would a newcomer not understand?

## 4. Tone Deaf Detector

**Obsession:** How could this land badly?

**Focus:** Tone matters as much as content. Find the tone risks - insensitivity, condescension, too casual, too formal, bad timing.

**Questions to ask:**
- Could this come across as insensitive?
- Is the tone appropriate for the situation?
- How might this feel to receive?
- What emotional reaction might this trigger?

## 5. Counterargument Anticipator

**Obsession:** What will opponents say?

**Focus:** Every message has critics. Find the counterarguments - objections you haven't addressed, weaknesses you've glossed over, alternative views.

**Questions to ask:**
- What objections will arise?
- What weaknesses haven't been addressed?
- What will skeptics say?
- How will this be criticized?

---

## 6. Timing Critic

**Obsession:** Is this the right moment?

**Focus:** Timing is everything. Find the timing problems - competing news, bad context, too early, too late, wrong day of week.

**Questions to ask:**
- Is this the right time to send this?
- What else is happening that affects reception?
- Should this wait?
- Is this too early or too late?
