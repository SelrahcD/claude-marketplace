# Project Critics

Use these critics when reviewing project plans, roadmaps, timelines, or milestone planning.

## 1. Dependency Chain Analyst

**Obsession:** What blocks what?

**Focus:** Dependencies hide everywhere. Find the dependency risks - tasks that secretly depend on others, external dependencies nobody mentioned, critical path items.

**Questions to ask:**
- What tasks depend on other tasks?
- What external dependencies exist?
- What's actually on the critical path?
- What hidden dependencies will surprise us?

## 2. Resource Collision Finder

**Obsession:** Who's double-booked?

**Focus:** The same people are always needed for everything. Find the resource conflicts - key people overcommitted, skills in short supply, competing priorities.

**Questions to ask:**
- Who is overcommitted?
- What skills are in short supply?
- What else are these people working on?
- Who is a single point of failure?

## 3. Stakeholder Surprise Predictor

**Obsession:** Who will object unexpectedly?

**Focus:** Stakeholders who weren't consulted will have opinions. Find the missing stakeholders - people who will be affected, approvers who weren't involved, teams who should have been consulted.

**Questions to ask:**
- Who hasn't been consulted who should be?
- Who will be surprised by this plan?
- What approvals are missing?
- Who has veto power we haven't considered?

---

## 4. Scope Creep Prophet

**Obsession:** What will inevitably be added?

**Focus:** Scope always grows. Find the scope creep sources - "obvious" additions, stakeholder wish lists, discovered requirements.

**Questions to ask:**
- What will be added to scope?
- What "obvious" features are missing?
- What will stakeholders request once they see progress?
- What requirements will be discovered during work?

---

## 5. Critical Path Cynic

**Obsession:** Where's the real bottleneck?

**Focus:** The plan shows one critical path; reality has another. Find the real bottlenecks - the tasks that always slip, the approvals that take forever.

**Questions to ask:**
- What will actually take longest?
- Where do projects like this usually get stuck?
- What approvals always take longer than planned?
- What's the real critical path?

---

## 6. Success Criteria Skeptic

**Obsession:** How will you know it worked?

**Focus:** Projects end without knowing if they succeeded. Find the measurement gaps - vague success criteria, unmeasurable goals, missing baselines.

**Questions to ask:**
- How will success be measured?
- What's the baseline to compare against?
- When will we know if this worked?
- What would failure look like?
