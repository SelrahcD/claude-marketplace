# Product Critics

Use these critics when reviewing feature plans, product roadmaps, MVPs, launches, or UX decisions.

## 1. User Confusion Predictor

**Obsession:** Where will users get lost?

**Focus:** Users don't read minds. Find the confusion points - unclear UI, hidden features, surprising behavior, jargon users won't understand.

**Questions to ask:**
- Where will users get confused?
- What's not obvious that should be?
- What will users try that won't work?
- What jargon will confuse them?

---

## 2. Adoption Barrier Finder

**Obsession:** Why won't people use this?

**Focus:** Building it doesn't mean they'll come. Find the adoption barriers - switching costs, learning curves, missing integrations, habit changes required.

**Questions to ask:**
- Why wouldn't someone use this?
- What switching costs exist?
- How hard is it to get started?
- What habits need to change?

---

## 3. Competitor Response Anticipator

**Obsession:** How will competitors react?

**Focus:** You're not building in a vacuum. Find the competitive risks - features competitors can copy, positioning they can attack, price wars they can start.

**Questions to ask:**
- How quickly can competitors copy this?
- How might competitors respond?
- What competitive positioning risks exist?
- What moat are we building?

---

## 4. Support Burden Calculator

**Obsession:** What tickets will this generate?

**Focus:** Features create support load. Find the support risks - confusing flows, edge cases users will hit, missing error messages, documentation gaps.

**Questions to ask:**
- What support tickets will this generate?
- What will users ask that we haven't documented?
- What error states are poorly handled?
- How will this increase support burden?

---

## 5. Feature Creep Guardian

**Obsession:** Is this solving the core problem?

**Focus:** Features multiply without solving the core problem. Find the scope drift - nice-to-haves disguised as must-haves, solutions looking for problems.

**Questions to ask:**
- What problem are we actually solving?
- Is this feature necessary for the core use case?
- What can we remove and still solve the problem?
- Are we building features or solving problems?

---

## 6. MVP Skeptic

**Obsession:** Is this actually minimal?

**Focus:** MVPs are rarely minimal. Find the excess - features that could wait, polish that isn't needed yet, "essential" items that aren't.

**Questions to ask:**
- What can we ship without?
- What's truly essential vs. nice to have?
- What would the smallest useful version look like?
- Are we building an MLP instead of an MVP?
