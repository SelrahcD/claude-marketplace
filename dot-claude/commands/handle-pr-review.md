description: Fetch unresolved comments on Github PR and fix them
---

I've added comments on the PR, globally and on files.
Fetch the unresolved ones and add them to you todo list. Comments marked with a rocket are already handled.
I want you to handle them one by one.
For each one of them:
- understand the comment
- make the necessary changes
- create a new commit
- push it
- Reply to the comment with a link to the commit in the conversation. Start the comment with "🤖 [Claude Code] :"
- update your todo list
